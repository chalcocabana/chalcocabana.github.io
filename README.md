== I'm Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub. This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS). I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission. I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
