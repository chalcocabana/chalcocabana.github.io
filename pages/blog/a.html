<h1>4/11/2022</h1>
<div class="a">
<p>Hello. This is the first installment of hopefully many but ultimately probably only a few blog posts here. Tonight I am going to go see the movie “Everything Everywhere All at Once” by Daniels with my friend Brent. He’s a long drink of water if I’ve ever seen one. Real tall. I’m wearing an AIDS camp shirt my ex got while working at Pizza Hut in Wisconsin and some pants my friend named Scott gave me. I hope this is a fun time out. I haven’t been out of the house much since my stepdad died a few weeks ago. I have been in what I would like to call a fugue state but what is probably more accurately referred to as a deep sadness that colors how I’ve been seeing the world. Earlier today I set up a brokerage account and got all my cryptocurrencies in order and will start monitoring them more closely at opening bell tomorrow. The 1 hour reminder alarm just went off for my movie date with my pal. Hopefully there is enough information here to paint a picture of how big a clown I really am.</p>
