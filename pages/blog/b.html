<div class="a">
<p>I want to write an extended review of the movie, Everything Everywhere All at Once, but I would like to put some thoughts out there while also getting a blog post written.</p>
<p>The movie was incredible. Daniels really created something magical with this film. There was an almost indescribably transcendent feeling seeing Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and James Hong on the screen, in their roles, in our world, in this time. The movie is at it’s heart a story of motherhood, and the Asian immigrant experience but not in the way that will alienate anybody. Comparing it to Parasite, I think it is much more fun and tackles it’s themes much more completely.</p>
<p>I highly recommend everyone go see this movie. I am going to go to bed and continue thinking about this movie.</p>
